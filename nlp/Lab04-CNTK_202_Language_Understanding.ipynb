We strongly recommend to run this tutorial on a machine with\na capable CUDA-compatible GPU. Deep learning without GPUs is not fun."

There are 11 entries with this sequence id. This means that sequence 19 consists\nof 11 tokens;\n* column `S0`, which contains numeric word indices; the input data is encoded in one-hot vectors.  There are 943 words in the vocabulary, so each word is a 943 element vector of all 0 with a 1 at a vector index chosen to represent that word.  For example the word \"from\" is represented with a 1 at index 444 and zero everywhere else in the vector. The word \"monday\" is represented with a 1 at index 601 and zero everywhere else in the vector.\n* a comment column denoted by `#`, to allow a human reader to know what the numeric word index stands for;\nComment columns are ignored by the system. `BOS` and `EOS` are special words\nto denote beginning and end of sentence, respectively;\n* column `S1` is an intent label, which we will only use in the last part of the tutorial;\n* another comment column that shows the human-readable label of the numeric intent index;\n* column `S2` is the slot label, represented as a numeric index; and\n* another comment column that shows the human-readable label of the numeric label index.\n\nThe task of the neural network is to look at the query (column `S0`) and predict the\nslot label (column `S2`).\nAs you can see, each word in the input gets assigned either an empty label `O`\nor a slot label that begins with `B-` for the first word, and with `I-` for any\nadditional consecutive word that belongs to the same slot.\n\nThe model we will use is a recurrent model consisting of an embedding layer,\na recurrent LSTM cell, and a dense layer to compute the posterior probabilities:\n\n\n    slot label   \"O\"        \"O\"        \"O\"        \"O\"  \"B-fromloc.city_name\"\n                  ^          ^          ^          ^          ^\n                  |          |          |          |          |\n              +-------+  +-------+  +-------+  +-------+  +-------+\n              | Dense |  | Dense |  | Dense |  | Dense |  | Dense |  ...\n              +-------+  +-------+  +-------+  +-------+  +-------+\n                  ^          ^          ^          ^          ^\n                  |          |          |          |          |\n              +------+   +------+   +------+   +------+   +------+   \n         0 -->| LSTM |-->| LSTM |-->| LSTM |-->| LSTM |-->| LSTM |-->...\n              +------+   +------+   +------+   +------+   +------+   \n                  ^          ^          ^          ^          ^\n                  |          |          |          |          |\n              +-------+  +-------+  +-------+  +-------+  +-------+\n              | Embed |  | Embed |  | Embed |  | Embed |  | Embed |  ...\n              +-------+  +-------+  +-------+  +-------+  +-------+\n                  ^          ^          ^          ^          ^\n                  |          |          |          |          |\n    w      ------>+--------->+--------->+--------->+--------->+------... \n                 BOS      \"show\"    \"flights\"    \"from\"   \"burbank\"\n\nOr, as a CNTK network description.

You can access its parameter `E` (where the embeddings are stored) like any other attribute of a Python object.

The `Dense` layer has both `weight` and `bias` parameters, one each per `Dense` layer. Bias terms are by default initialized to 0 (but there is a way to change that if you need). As you create the model, one should name the layer component and then access the parameters as shown here. \n\n**Suggested task**: What should be the expected dimension of the `weight` matrix from the layer named `classify`?

In most tutorials, we know the input dimensions and the corresponding labels. We directly create the loss and the error functions. In this tutorial we will do the same. However, we take a brief detour and learn about placeholders. This concept would be useful for Task 3. \n\n**Learning note**: Introduction to `placeholder`: Remember that the code we have been writing is not actually executing any heavy computation it is just specifying the function we want to compute on data during training/testing. And in the same way that it is convenient to have names for arguments when you write a regular function in a programming language, it is convenient to have placeholders that refer to arguments (or local computations that need to be reused). Eventually, some other code will replace these placeholders with other known quantities in the same way that in a programming language the function will be called with concrete values bound to its arguments. \n\nSpecifically, the input variables you have created above `x = C.sequence.input_variable(vocab_size)` holds data pre-defined by `vocab_size`. In the case where such instantiations are challenging or not possible, using `placeholder` is a logical choice. Having the `placeholder` only allows you to defer the specification of the argument at a later time when you may have the data.\n\nHere is an example below that illustrates the use of `placeholder`."

      "source": "### Task 3: Bidirectional Recurrent Model\n\nAha, knowledge of future words help. So instead of a one-word lookahead,\nwhy not look ahead until all the way to the end of the sentence, through a backward recurrence?\nLet us create a bidirectional model!\n\nYour task is to implement a new layer that\nperforms both a forward and a backward recursion over the data, and\nconcatenates the output vectors.\n\nNote, however, that this differs from the previous task in that\nthe bidirectional layer contains learnable model parameters.\nIn function-composition style,\nthe pattern to implement a layer with model parameters is to write a *factory function*\nthat creates a *function object*.\n\nA function object, also known as [*functor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_object), is an object that is both a function and an object.\nWhich means nothing else that it contains data yet still can be invoked as if it was a function.\n\nFor example, `Dense(outDim)` is a factory function that returns a function object that contains\na weight matrix `W`, a bias `b`, and another function to compute \n`input @ W + b.` (This is using \n[Python 3.5 notation for matrix multiplication](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html#whatsnew-pep-465).\nIn Numpy syntax it is `input.dot(W) + b`).\nE.g. saying `Dense(1024)` will create this function object, which can then be used\nlike any other function, also immediately: `Dense(1024)(x)`. \n\nLet's look at an example for further clarity: Let us implement a new layer that combines\na linear layer with a subsequent batch normalization. \nTo allow function composition, the layer needs to be realized as a factory function,\nwhich could look like this:\n\n```python\ndef DenseLayerWithBN(dim):\n    F = Dense(dim)\n    G = BatchNormalization()\n    x = placeholder()\n    apply_x = G(F(x))\n    return apply_x\n```\n\nInvoking this factory function will create `F`, `G`, `x`, and `apply_x`. In this example, `F` and `G` are function objects themselves, and `apply_x` is the function to be applied to the data.\nThus, e.g. calling `DenseLayerWithBN(1024)` will\ncreate an object containing a linear-layer function object called `F`, a batch-normalization function object `G`,\nand `apply_x` which is the function that implements the actual operation of this layer\nusing `F` and `G`. It will then return `apply_x`. To the outside, `apply_x` looks and behaves\nlike a function. Under the hood, however, `apply_x` retains access to its specific instances of `F` and `G`.\n\nNow back to our task at hand. You will now need to create a factory function,\nvery much like the example above.\nYou shall create a factory function\nthat creates two recurrent layer instances (one forward, one backward), and then defines an `apply_x` function\nwhich applies both layer instances to the same `x` and concatenate the two results.\n\nAlright, give it a try! To know how to realize a backward recursion in CNTK,\nplease take a hint from how the forward recursion is done.\nPlease also do the following:\n* remove the one-word lookahead you added in the previous task, which we aim to replace; and\n* make sure each LSTM is using `hidden_dim//2` outputs to keep the total number of model parameters limited."
