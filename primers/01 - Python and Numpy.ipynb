It's extremely popular in the data science and artificial intelligence (AI) community. If you're familiar with other programming languages, like Java or Microsoft C#, Python can seem a little confusing at first, This notebook is designed to offer a crash course in some of the key features of the language for existing programmers who are new to Python and the Jupyter notebook environment.\n\n## Getting Help\nOne of the most useful features of Python is its built-in help feature. You can use the **help** function to view documentation for specific commands.\n\nRun the following cell to try it for yourself.\n\n(To run the cell, place the cursor in it and click the  **&#9658;I Run** button. The **&#9711;** symbol next to the **Python 3.6** kernel name at the top right will briefly turn to **&#9899;** while the cell runs before turning back to **&#9711;**.)"

To see how this works,, in the empty cell below type `print('Hello', 'World',` and then press the **Tab** key. This displays a scrollable list of contextual commands that you can use to complete your **print** statement. You can select a command in the list by scrolling to it with the arrow keys and pressing **Enter**, or by clicking it. Try using this technique to select the `sep=` argument to add it to your statement, and then complete the command to read `print('Hello', 'World',sep='\\n')`. Running this command produces the following output:\n>Hello<br/>World"
