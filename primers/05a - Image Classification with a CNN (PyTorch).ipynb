      "source": "# Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n\"Deep Learning\" is a general term that usually refers to the use of neural networks with multiple layers that synthesize the way the human brain learns and makes decisions. A convolutional neural network is a kind of neural network that extracts *features* from matrices of numeric values (often images) by convolving multiple filters over the matrix values to apply weights and identify patterns, such as edges, corners, and so on in an image. The numeric representations of these patterns are then passed to a fully-connected neural network layer to map the features to specific classes.\n\n## Basic Neural Network Recap\n\nYour brain works by connecting networks of neurons, each of which receives electrochemical stimuli from multiple inputs, which cause the neuron to fire under certain conditions. When a neuron fires, it creates an electrochemical charge that is passed as an input to one or more other neurons, creating a complex *feed-forward* network made up of layers of neurons that pass the signal on. An artificial neural network uses the same principles but the inputs are numeric values with associated *weights* that reflect their relative importance. The neuron take these input values and weights and applies them to an *activation function* that determines the ouput that the artificial neuron passes onto the next layer:\n\n<br/>\n<div align=\"center\" style='font-size:24px;'>&#8694;&#9711;&rarr;</div>\n\nAs the human brain learns from experience, the inputs to the neurons are strenghtened or weakened depending on their importance to the decisions that the brain needs to make in response to stimuli. Similarly, you train an artificial neural network using a supervised leaning technique in which a *loss function* is used to evaluate how well the multi-layered model detects known labels. You can then find the derivative of the loss function to determine whether the level of error (loss) is reduced by increasing or decreasing the weights associated with the inputs, and then apply *backpropagation* to adjust the weights and improve the model iteratively over multiple training *epochs*. The result of this training is a deep learning model that consists of:\n* An *input* layer to which the initial input variables are passed.\n* One or more *hidden* layers in which the weights optimized by training determine the signal that is fed forward through the network.\n* An *output* layer that presents the results.\n\n## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\nConvolutional Neural Networks, or *CNNs*, are a particular type of artificial neural network that works well with matrix inputs, such as images (which are fundamentally just multi-dimensional matrices of pixel intensity values). There are various kinds of layer in a CNN, but a common architecture is to build a sequence of *convolutional* layers that find patterns in indvidual areas of the input matrix and *pooling* layers that aggregate these patterns. Additionally, some layers may *drop* data (which helps avoid *overfitting* the model to the training data), and finally some layers will *flatten* the matrix data and a linear *dense*, or *fully connected* layer will perform classification and reshape the predictions to conform with the expected output format.\n\nConceptually, a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification is made up of multiple layers that extract features, such as edges, corners, etc; followed by one or more fully-connected layers to classify objects based on these features. You can visualize this like this:\n\n<table>\n    <tr><td rowspan=2 style='border: 1px solid black;'>&#x21d2;</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>Convolutional Layer</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>Pooling Layer</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>Convolutional Layer</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>Pooling Layer</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>Drop Layer</td><td style='border: 1px solid black;'>Fully Connected Layer</td><td rowspan=2 style='border: 1px solid black;'>&#x21d2;</td></tr>\n    <tr><td colspan=5 style='border: 1px solid black; text-align:center;'>Feature Extraction</td><td style='border: 1px solid black; text-align:center;'>Classification</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n*Note: In Machine Learning, particularly \"deep learning\", matrices used in neural networks are often referred to as **tensors**. In a simplistic (which is to say, not strictly accurate) sense, a tensor is just a generalized term for a multi-dimensional matrix. In some deep learning frameworks, like PyTorch, a tensor is a specific type of data structure with properties and methods that support deep learning operations.*\n\n### Convolutional Layers\nConvolutional layers apply filters to a subregion of the input image, and *convolve* the filter across the image to extract features (such as edges, corners, etc.). For example, suppose the following matrix represents the pixels in a 6x6 image:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}255 & 255 & 255 & 255 & 255 & 255\\\\255 & 255 & 0 & 0 & 255 & 255\\\\255 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 255\\\\255 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 255\\\\255 & 255 & 0 & 0 & 255 & 255\\\\255 & 255 & 255 & 255 & 255 & 255\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nAnd let's suppose that a filter matrix is defined as a matrix of *weight* values like this:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 & 0\\\\0 & 1 & 0\\\\0 & 1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nThe convolution layer applies the filter to the image matrix one \"patch\" at a time; so the first operation would apply to the <span style=\"color:red\">red</span> elements below:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}\\color{red}{255} & \\color{red}{255} & \\color{red}{255} & 255 & 255 & 255\\\\\\color{red}{255} & \\color{red}{255} & \\color{red}{0} & 0 & 255 & 255\\\\\\color{red}{255} & \\color{red}{0} & \\color{red}{0} & 0 & 0 & 255\\\\255 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 255\\\\255 & 255 & 0 & 0 & 255 & 255\\\\255 & 255 & 255 & 255 & 255 & 255\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nTo apply the filter, we multiply the patch area by the filter elementwise, and add the results:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}255 & 255 & 255\\\\255 & 255 & 0\\\\255 & 0 & 0\\end{bmatrix} \\times \\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 & 0\\\\0 & 1 & 0\\\\0 & 1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}= \\begin{bmatrix}(255 \\times 0) + (255 \\times 1) + (255 \\times 0) & +\\\\ (255 \\times 0) + (255 \\times 1) + (0 \\times 0) & + \\\\ (255 \\times 0) + (0 \\times 1) + (0 \\times 0)\\end{bmatrix}  = 510$$\n\nThis result is then used as the value for the first element of a feature map:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}\\color{red}{510} & ? & ? & ?\\\\? & ? & ? & ?\\\\? & ? & ? & ?\\\\? & ? & ? & ?\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nNext we move the patch along one pixel and apply the filter to the new patch area:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}255 & \\color{red}{255} & \\color{red}{255} & \\color{red}{255} & 255 & 255\\\\255 & \\color{red}{255} & \\color{red}{0} & \\color{red}{0} & 255 & 255\\\\255 & \\color{red}{0} & \\color{red}{0} & \\color{red}{0} & 0 & 255\\\\255 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 255\\\\255 & 255 & 0 & 0 & 255 & 255\\\\255 & 255 & 255 & 255 & 255 & 255\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}255 & 255 & 255\\\\255 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0\\end{bmatrix} \\times \\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 & 0\\\\0 & 1 & 0\\\\0 & 1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}= \\begin{bmatrix}(255 \\times 0) + (255 \\times 1) + (255 \\times 0) & +\\\\ (255 \\times 0) + (0 \\times 1) + (0 \\times 0) & + \\\\ (0 \\times 0) + (0 \\times 1) + (0 \\times 0)\\end{bmatrix}  = 255 $$\n\nSo can fill in that value on our feature map:\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}510 & \\color{red}{255} & ? & ?\\\\? & ? & ? & ?\\\\? & ? & ? & ?\\\\? & ? & ? & ?\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nThen we just repeat the process, moving the patch across the entire image matrix until we have a completed feature map like this:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}510 & 255 & 255 & 510\\\\255 & 0 & 0 & 255\\\\255 & 0 & 0 & 255\\\\510 & 255 & 255 & 510\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nYou'll have noticed that as a result of convolving a patch across the original image, we've \"lost\" a 1-pixel strip around the edge. Typically, we apply a *padding* rule to keep the convolved image the same size as the original image, often by simply filling creating a 1-pixel wide edge with 0 values, like this:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 510 & 255 & 255 & 510 & 0\\\\0 & 255 & 0 & 0 & 255 & 0\\\\0 & 255 & 0 & 0 & 255 & 0\\\\0 & 510 & 255 & 255 & 510 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n### Pooling Layers\nAfter using one or more convolution layers to create a filter map, you can use a pooling layer to  reduce the number of dimensions in the matrix. A common technique is to use *MaxPooling*, in which a patch is applied to the matrix and the maximum value within the mask is retained while the others are discarded.\n\nFor example, we could apply a 2x2 patch to our feature map to extract the largest value in each 2x2 subarea:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}\\color{blue}{0} & \\color{blue}{0} & \\color{green}{0} & \\color{green}{0} & \\color{red}{0} & \\color{red}{0}\\\\\\color{blue}{0} & \\color{blue}{510} & \\color{green}{255} & \\color{green}{255} & \\color{red}{510} & \\color{red}{0}\\\\\\color{magenta}{0} & \\color{magenta}{255} & \\color{orange}{0} & \\color{orange}{0} & \\color{cyan}{255} & \\color{cyan}{0}\\\\\\color{magenta}{0} & \\color{magenta}{255} & \\color{orange}{0} & \\color{orange}{0} & \\color{cyan}{255} & \\color{cyan}{0}\\\\\\color{brown}{0} & \\color{brown}{510} & 255 & 255 & \\color{yellow}{510} & \\color{yellow}{0}\\\\\\color{brown}{0} & \\color{brown}{0} & 0 & 0 & \\color{yellow}{0} & \\color{yellow}{0}\\end{bmatrix}\\Longrightarrow \\begin{bmatrix}\\color{blue}{510} & \\color{green}{255} & \\color{red}{510}\\\\\\color{magenta}{255} & \\color{orange}{0} & \\color{cyan}{255}\\\\\\color{brown}{510} & 255 & \\color{yellow}{510}\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n### Activation Functions\nAfter each layer of filtering or pooling, it's common to apply a *rectified linear unit (ReLU)* function to the feature maps that have been produced. This has the effect of ensuring that all values in the feature maps are zero or higher.\n\n### Dropout Layers\nIn any machine learning training process, there is a danger of *overfitting* the model to the training data. In other words, you might end with a model that works extremely well with the data on which it was trained, but can't generalize effectively to classify new images. One way in which you can reduce the risk of overfitting is to randomly drop some of the feature maps.\n\n### Dense (Fully-Connected) Layers\nAfter the previous layers have created feature maps, a final linear *fully-connected* layer is used to generate class predictions - you can think of the fully-connected layer as being the endpoint of the classifier what determines which combination of features found in the previous layers \"adds up\" to a particular class. To create a fully-connected layer, the feature maps are flattened into a single 1-dimensional matrix and a function is applied to calculate the probability for each class that the model is designed to predict - usually this final function is a *Sigmoid* or *SoftMax* function that assigns a value between 0 and 1 to each class, with the total of these assignments adding to 1:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}510 & 255 & 510\\\\255 & 0 & 255\\\\510 & 255 & 510\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}255 & 255 & 510\\\\255 & 0 & 255\\\\510 & 255 & 255\\end{bmatrix}...$$\n\n$$ \\Downarrow $$\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}510 & 255 & 510 & 255 & 0 & 255 & 510 & 255 & 510 & 255 & 255 & 510 & 255 & 0 & 255 & 510 & 255 & 255 ...\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n$$ \\Downarrow $$\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}C_{1} & C_{2} & C_{3} \\\\ 0.15 & 0.8 & 0.05\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n### Backpropagation\nWhen we train a CNN, we perform mulitple passes forward through the network of layers, and then use a *loss function* to measure the difference between the output values (which you may recall are probability predictions for each class) and the actual values for the known image classes used to train the model (in other words, 1 for the correct class and 0 for all the others). For example, in the example above the predicted probabilities are 0.15 for C<sub>1</sub>, 0.8 for C<sub>2</sub>, and 0.05 for C<sub>3</sub>. Let's suppose that the image in question is an example of C<sub>2</sub>, so the expected output is actually 0 for C<sub>1</sub>, 1 for C<sub>2</sub>, and 0 for C<sub>3</sub>. The error (or *loss*) represents how far from the expected values our results are.\n\nHaving calculated the loss, the training process uses a specified *optimizer* to calculate the derivitive of the loss function and determine how best to adjust the weights applied in the hidden layers to reduce the loss. We then go backwards through the network, adjusting the weights before the next forward pass.\n\n## Simulating Feature Extraction\nThe use of convolutional and pooling layers to extract features can seem a little abstract. It can be helpful to visualize the outputs of these layers to better understand how they help identify visual features in the images, reducing the size of the feature matrices that are passed to the fully-connected classification network layers at the end of the model.\n\nThe following code generates a sample image of a geometric shape, and then simulates the following feature extraction layers to simulate convolutional and pooling layers in a CNN:"

We'll also use a separate set of test images to test the model at the end of each iteration (or *epoch*) so we can track the performance improvement as the training process progresses.\n\nIn the example below, we use 5 epochs to train the model using the batches of images loaded by the data loaders, holding back the data in the test data loader for validation. After each epoch, a loss function measures the error (*loss*) in the model and adjusts the weights (which were randomly generated for the first iteration) to try to improve accuracy. \n\n> **Note**: We're only using 5 epochs to reduce the training time for this simple example. A real-world CNN is usually trained over more epochs than this. CNN model training is processor-intensive, so it's recommended to perform this on a system that can leverage GPUs (such as the Data Science Virtual Machine in Azure) to reduce training time. This will take a while to complete in Azure Notebooks (in which GPUs are not available) - status will be displayed as the training progresses. Feel free to go get some coffee!"
